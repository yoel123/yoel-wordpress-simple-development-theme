this is a simple wordpress theme framework meant to be used for creating wp themes.<br>
for now its only for programmers, in the future i will simplify it even more for client side developers.

this is only the first version and a work in progress. later i will implement other wordpress api features

i will also create a guide on how to use it (although its simple and straight forward).

i work on a few other projects so it will take time to update this.
